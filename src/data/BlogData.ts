        <h2 id="lohagad-fort">🏰 Lohagad Fort - The Impregnable Iron Fort</h2>
        
        <div class="callout callout-highlight">
          <h4>🎯 Quick Facts</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Distance from Pawana Lake:</strong> 15 km (30 minutes drive)</li>
            <li><strong>Trek Duration:</strong> 1-2 hours</li>

            <li><strong>Difficulty Level:</strong> Easy to Moderate</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Lohagad Fort</strong>, meaning "Iron Fort," is one of Maharashtra's most popular trekking destinations and a crown jewel among <strong>tourist attractions near Pawana Lake</strong>. This 18th-century fort played a crucial role in Maratha history and was once the treasury of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.</p>

        <h3>Why Lohagad Fort is Special:</h3>

        <div class="callout callout-tip">
          <h4>🌟 Pro Tip</h4>
          <p>Visit during monsoon for lush green landscapes, but be extra careful on wet rocks. Winter offers the clearest views and most comfortable trekking conditions.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>What to Expect:</h3>
        <p>The trek to Lohagad begins from Malavli village and follows a well-marked stone path built by the Marathas. The fort features four gates - Ganesh Darwaza, Narayan Darwaza, Hanuman Darwaza, and Maha Darwaza. The highlight is the Vinchu Kata (Scorpion's Tail), a narrow fortification that extends from the main fort, offering breathtaking views of the surrounding valleys.</p>

        <h2 id="tikona-fort">⛰️ Tikona Fort - The Triangular Marvel</h2>

        <p><strong>Tikona Fort</strong>, also known as Vitandgad, gets its name from its distinctive triangular shape when viewed from the base. This lesser-known gem is perfect for those seeking a more challenging trek and pristine natural beauty.</p>

        <div class="callout callout-info">
          <h4>📍 Essential Information</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Distance from Pawana Lake:</strong> 25 km (45 minutes drive)</li>
            <li><strong>Trek Duration:</strong> 2-3 hours</li>
            <li><strong>Difficulty Level:</strong> Moderate to Challenging</li>
            <li><strong>Height:</strong> 3,633 feet above sea level</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Unique Features:</h3>
